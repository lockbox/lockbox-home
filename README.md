# home config

This repo is a Guix home configuration that is starting to get less sprawled out
and slowly transitioning over to use more of the modern [Guix Home Services](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Home-Services.html).

This has only been tested on foreign distros (namely Gentoo and Fedora) as I only
run Guix the distribution on remote hosts.
